Here’s a clear, short write-up about William Blake you can use:

---

William Blake (1757–1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker, now regarded as one of the most original and influential figures of the Romantic Age. During his lifetime he was considered eccentric and even obscure, but today he is celebrated for the visionary quality of his art and writing. Blake combined poetry, painting, and engraving in a unique way, producing works in which text and image reinforce each other. <br><br><br>

His poetry often explored themes of innocence and experience, freedom and oppression, spirituality, and the imagination. Famous collections such as Songs of Innocence and of Experience show his contrast between childlike purity and the harsh realities of society. Blake also produced long, symbolic poems—often called “prophetic books”—in which he created his own mythological world to express complex ideas about religion, politics, and human nature. <br> <br><br>

Besides his writing, Blake’s illustrations and engravings—such as those for Dante’s Divine Comedy or the Bible—are renowned for their bold lines, vivid colors, and imaginative energy. Though largely unrecognized in his own time, Blake is now seen as a pioneer of both Romantic literature and modern art, inspiring later poets, artists, and thinkers with his intense vision of the human spirit. <br> <br>

Would you like me to make it even simpler (like for a school project) or keep it at this level?
